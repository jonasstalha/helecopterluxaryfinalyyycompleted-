## 🚨 STRIPE API KEY FIX REQUIRED

### Problem Identified:
Your current Stripe live API key is **invalid or corrupted**. Stripe is rejecting it with error: "Invalid API Key provided"

### ✅ TEMPORARY FIX APPLIED:
I've temporarily switched your backend to use Stripe **TEST MODE** so you can test the functionality.

### 🔧 STEPS TO GET YOUR CORRECT STRIPE LIVE API KEY:

#### 1. Go to Your Stripe Dashboard
- Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
- Sign in to your Stripe account

#### 2. Navigate to API Keys
- In the left sidebar, click **"Developers"**
- Click **"API keys"**

#### 3. Find Your Secret Key
- Look for **"Secret key"** (it starts with `sk_live_...`)
- Click **"Reveal test key"** or the eye icon
- **COPY THE ENTIRE KEY** (it should be much longer than what you had)

#### 4. Update Your Backend .env File
Replace the current test key in `backend/.env` with your live key:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_LONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

#### 5. Restart Backend Server
After updating the key:
- Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
- Restart it: `npm start` from the backend directory

### 🧪 CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3001
- ✅ Using Stripe TEST MODE (temporary)
- ✅ Google Sheets CORS fixed
- ✅ Environment variables loading correctly

### 🔍 TESTING:
You can now test the booking flow with:
- Test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Any future expiry date
- Any 3-digit CVC

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. **Test mode** means no real payments will be processed
2. You **MUST** replace with live keys for production
3. Never share your secret keys publicly
4. The live key should be much longer than what you had

### 📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. Get correct live Stripe API key from dashboard
2. Update Google Apps Script (redeploy with CORS fixes)
3. Test complete booking flow
4. Switch to live mode when ready

### 🎯 Expected Live Key Format:
```
sk_live_51[lots of characters here]
```
Your old key appeared to be truncated or corrupted.
