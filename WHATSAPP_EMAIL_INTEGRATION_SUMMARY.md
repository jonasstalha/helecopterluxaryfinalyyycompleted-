## 🔧 Current Issues and Solutions:

### 2. Stripe HTTPS Warning
- **Issue**: "You may test your Stripe.js integration over HTTP. However, live Stripe.js integrations must use HTTPS."
- **Solution**: This is expected in development. For production, use HTTPS.

### 3. Google Sheets CORS Error
- **Issue**: CORS policy blocking Google Apps Script calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Update Google Apps Script with CORS headers (see `CORS_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
  - Redeploy the script
  - Test the deployment

### 4. Stripe 401 Unauthorized
- **Issue**: Stripe API key configuration issues
- **Solution**: Check Stripe API keys in environment variables
